## 1. US Medical Insurance Cost Analysis 

This repository contains code to analyze a dataset on US Medical Insurance cost. The goal is to extract useful insights from the data using Python and pandas library.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is in the CSV format and contains the following columns:

 - age: age of primary beneficiary
 - sex: gender of primary beneficiary
 - bmi: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the primary beneficiary
 - children: number of children covered by the insurance plan
 - smoker: whether the primary beneficiary is a smoker or not
 - region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US
 - charges: individual medical costs billed by health insurance

### Code
The code is written in Python and uses the pandas library for data analysis. It performs the following analysis on the dataset:

 - Find out the average age of the patients in the dataset
 - Analyze where a majority of the individuals are from
 - Look at the different costs between smokers vs. non-smokers
 - Figure out what the average age is for someone who has at least one child in this dataset
 - How does BMI (body mass index) differ between smokers and non-smokers in the dataset
 - What is the average insurance charge for males versus females in the dataset

### Conclusion
 The analysis of the dataset provides useful insights into the medical insurance costs in the US. The findings include the average age of patients, the majority of individuals by region, the cost differences between smokers vs. non-smokers, the average age of someone with at least one child, the BMI differences between smokers and non-smokers, and the average insurance charges for males versus females. These insights can be helpful in making informed decisions about health insurance coverage.
