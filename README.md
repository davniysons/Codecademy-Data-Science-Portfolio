## 1. US Medical Insurance Cost Analysis 

This repository contains code to analyze a dataset on US Medical Insurance cost. The goal is to extract useful insights from the data using Python and pandas library.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is in the CSV format and contains the following columns:

 - age: age of primary beneficiary
 - sex: gender of primary beneficiary
 - bmi: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the primary beneficiary
 - children: number of children covered by the insurance plan
 - smoker: whether the primary beneficiary is a smoker or not
 - region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US
 - charges: individual medical costs billed by health insurance

### Code
The code is written in Python and uses the pandas library for data analysis. It performs the following analysis on the dataset:

 - Find out the average age of the patients in the dataset
 - Analyze where a majority of the individuals are from
 - Look at the different costs between smokers vs. non-smokers
 - Figure out what the average age is for someone who has at least one child in this dataset
 - How does BMI (body mass index) differ between smokers and non-smokers in the dataset
 - What is the average insurance charge for males versus females in the dataset

### Conclusion
 The analysis of the dataset provides useful insights into the medical insurance costs in the US. The findings include the average age of patients, the majority of individuals by region, the cost differences between smokers vs. non-smokers, the average age of someone with at least one child, the BMI differences between smokers and non-smokers, and the average insurance charges for males versus females. These insights can be helpful in making informed decisions about health insurance coverage.


 ## 2. Life Expectancy and GDP

### Dataset
This dataset provides a snapshot of the relationship between life expectancy at birth and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for different countries - Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, USA, Zimbabwe - spanning the years from 2000 to 2015. It presents a unique opportunity to analyze and compare how these key indicators of societal well-being and economic health have evolved over time across a diverse set of nations.

### Code
The code is written in Python and uses the pandas library for data analysis. It performs the following analysis on the dataset:

- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
- What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
- GDP and Life Expectancy Change: Analyze the yearly change in GDP and life expectancy for each country. 

### Conclusion
This analysis provided insights into the dynamics of life expectancy and GDP in six diverse nations from 2000 to 2015.
While there is a positive correlation between a country's GDP and life expectancy, the relationship is not very strong, indicating that other factors also significantly impact life expectancy.
Over the years, most nations have seen an increase in both GDP and life expectancy, albeit to varying degrees. Zimbabwe stands out with a dramatic rise in life expectancy, despite a relatively steady GDP.
The distribution of life expectancy reveals a stark contrast between Zimbabwe and the other five nations, which may be due to various socio-economic factors unique to Zimbabwe.
