    "    - The average age of patients in the dataset is approximately 39 years.\n",
    "    - The majority of individuals in the dataset are from the Southeast region.\n",
    "    - The average insurance cost for smokers is significantly higher than that for non-smokers.\n",
    "    - The average age of individuals who have at least one child is slightly higher than that of those without children.\n",
    "    - There is no significant difference in BMI between smokers and non-smokers.\n",
    "    - The average insurance charge for males and females is approximately the same.\n",
